# Canadian Employment & Wages: Trends, Gender Gaps, and Sector Growth

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **employment and wage trends in Canada** using public datasets.  
The main focus is on:

- Wage gaps by **gender, region, and sector**
- Long-term **employment and workforce growth** trends
- Identifying which sectors have grown fastest in the last 20 years

## ❓ Research Questions

1. What are the wage gaps by gender, region, or sector in Canada?
2. Which sectors of the Canadian workforce grew fastest in the last 20 years?

## 📊 Data Sources
